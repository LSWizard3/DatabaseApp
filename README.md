# Student DatabaseApp


This application was inspired by my personal navigation of CUNYFirst system. As I would take time to
register for classes I would need to keep track of how much money I would have to pay for each class.
After creating this application I was able to apply it each semester before searching for classes
which allowed me to have such a more efficient and organized way to improve my experience as a student.
